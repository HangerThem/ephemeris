Hi there! I'm Frank Borisjuk, a software developer from the north of Czechia. At 20 years old, I'm already diving deep into the world of coding and technology, driven by a passion for learning and problem-solving.

## My Passions

- **Reading**: I have a deep appreciation for anything with a compelling story and excellent writing. J.R.R. Tolkien's works are some of my all-time favorites. I also enjoy self-help and personal development books like Atomic Habits and The 5 AM Club.
- **Video Games**: My gaming interests lean towards titles with rich narratives, such as Hollow Knight. I also enjoy relaxing games like Minecraft, Stardew Valley, and Terraria. I'm less into BA or FPS games.
- **TTRPG**: As a forever Dungeon Master, I revel in the creative process of world-building and storytelling. The camaraderie and creativity involved in role-playing games are what I love most.
- **Programming**: I primarily work in web development with JavaScript/TypeScript but enjoy exploring new technologies. My skills extend to C, C++, C#, Java, and Python. Currently, I'm working on a simple social network project with features inspired by Instagram and Twitter/X. You can check out my work on [GitHub](https://github.com/hangerthem).
- **Fitness**: I’m dedicated to going to the gym regularly. I believe that staying active and maintaining physical health is crucial for both mental and physical well-being.

## A Bit About Me

My journey into programming began with a love for learning and creating solutions. I enjoy the process of discovering new things and applying them to solve problems. In DnD, the joy comes from the shared experiences with friends and the creative thrill of crafting new worlds. As for balancing my time, I like to start with a simple plan for the day, focusing on what needs to be done and then following my interests as they come. I also make sure to hit the gym regularly, as I believe in the importance of physical fitness alongside my other passions.

Living in Czechia offers a great blend of modern comfort and rich culture. The country’s manageable size, good education and excellent healthcare systems, and renowned beer make it a wonderful place to call home.
