# Ephemeris

This is my personal blog where I share my thoughts, projects, and passions with you. It is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

The name "Ephemeris" comes from the Latin word for diary or journal. I chose this name because I see this blog as a place to document my thoughts and experiences, much like a diary.
