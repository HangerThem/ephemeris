Hello and welcome to my blog! I'm Frank Borisjuk, and I'm thrilled to have you here on this new journey of sharing my thoughts, projects, and passions with you.

## A Bit About Me

As you may have read on my "[About](/about)" page, I'm a 20-year-old software developer from Czechia with a passion for technology, reading, and gaming. When I'm not coding, you'll likely find me lost in a good book or enjoying a game with rich storytelling, like *Hollow Knight* or *Stardew Valley*. I also love the creativity involved in *Dungeons & Dragons* and *Warhammer 40k*, where I get to build new worlds and adventures. Additionally, I stay active by going to the gym regularly, which helps me maintain a balanced lifestyle.

## What to Expect

On this blog, I'll be sharing a mix of content, including:

- **Tech Insights**: From programming tips to insights on the latest technologies, I'll delve into the world of web development and beyond.
- **Book and Game Recommendations**: If you’re a fellow bookworm or gamer, you might find some interesting recommendations or reviews here.
- **Personal Musings**: Expect a few thoughts on life, learning, and the creative processes behind my projects.

## Why I Started This Blog

I wanted to create a space where I could share not only my knowledge and experiences but also connect with like-minded individuals. Whether you’re interested in tech, books, or just want to follow along with my projects and adventures, I hope this blog will offer something of value to you.

Thank you for stopping by, and here’s to many interesting discussions and discoveries ahead!

Best,
Frank
