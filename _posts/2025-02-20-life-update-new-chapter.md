It's been a while since my last update, and a lot has changed over the past few months. The biggest news? I dropped out of university about four months ago. While that might sound dramatic, the reality is that I wasn’t really enjoying it anymore. You might say that you are not really supposed to enjoy it but many of the subjects were things I had already studied, worked with professionally, or knew well enough that sitting through lectures felt redundant. On top of that, I received an offer to step into an IT Manager role at a company I had been working with for about a year and a half. Since it aligns perfectly with my major, it made more sense to take the job rather than spend the next five to six years studying something I was already doing in practice.

## Career Shift

Transitioning from being a university student to working full-time as an IT Manager has been an interesting experience. On one hand, it's incredibly rewarding to apply my knowledge directly and see the impact of my decisions. On the other hand, the sheer responsibility that comes with the role has been a significant adjustment. Managing a team (be it small one), handling infrastructure, and ensuring smooth operations requires constant focus, but it’s something I genuinely enjoy. The hands-on experience has been far more valuable than anything I was learning in class.

## Fitness Progress

On the fitness side, I’ve been hitting the gym consistently—about five to six times a week—and making solid progress. I recently hit a new personal record of 205 kg for my squat, which I’m pretty proud of. Strength training has become more than just a habit; it’s an essential part of my daily routine. Lately, I’ve also been considering the idea of competing. It’s something I was thinking about for some time now, and seeing my progress has made me think it could be a fun and worthwhile challenge.

## Teaching

In addition to my job, I’m still teaching IT at my alma mater, and I’ve been enjoying it quite a bit. It’s oddly relaxing in a way, and it’s nice to give back and help students develop their skills. Teaching has also given me a new perspective on the field—explaining concepts to others forces me to refine my own understanding, which has been a great side benefit.

## Balancing Work, Hobbies, and Life

Work has been keeping me incredibly busy. Between my job, teaching, and keeping up with my gym routine, I haven’t had as much time for my hobbies. Reading, gaming, and working on personal projects have taken a bit of a backseat. I still try to squeeze in moments here and there, but free time is definitely a rare commodity these days. It’s a trade-off I’m willing to make for now, but I do miss being able to just sit down and immerse myself in a game or a book for hours on end.

## Personal Projects

Speaking of personal projects, I’m still working on the Spin post whenever I manage to find a spare moment. It’s coming along slowly but surely. I’m aiming to get it finished soon, but with my current schedule, it’s tough to say exactly when that will be.

## Final Thoughts

That’s about it for now—just a quick update on what’s been going on. Life’s been hectic, but overall, I’m enjoying it. Even with all the responsibilities piling up, I wouldn’t have it any other way. Until next time!

Best, <br />
